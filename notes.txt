Every query is cached by default
 
User does not have to see loading indicator every time as queries are cached

Cache time can be configured for specific queries

When you are under cache time, The cached data is returned and background request is made to fetch data 

If data is same then you wont see any change on UI

If you move away from query then it is marked inactive and it is garbage collected after 5 seconds
